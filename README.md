# Raghu.fyi

Next.js based front end for my personal portfolio. 
- Frontendâ†”API: Frontend calls `/api/chat`; Next rewrites to FastAPI in dev and `/api/` in prod.

## Goals
- Smooth, low-jitter streaming TUI.
- Minimal client JS and dependencies.
- Keep server streaming unchanged.
- DRY terminal: reuse icons, keep CSS local to the component, extract large constants if helpful.
